		<h3>Left: Things We Find Important<br/>
		Below: His Story</h3>
		<p>Franz Xaver Winterhalter was born in the small village of Menzenschwand (now part of Sankt Blasien), in Germany's Black Forest in the Electorate of Baden, on 20 April 1805.</p>
		<p>He was the sixth child of Fidel Winterhalter (1773–1863), a farmer and resin producer in the village, and his wife Eva Meyer (1765–1838), a member of a long established Menzenschwand family.</p>
		<p>His father was of peasant stock and was a powerful influence in his life. Of the eight brothers and sisters, only four survived infancy.</p>
		<p>Throughout his life Franz Xaver remained very close to his family, in particular to his brother Hermann (1808–1891), who was also a painter.</p>
